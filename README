NAME

    dirq - C implementation of the simple directory queue algorithm

DESCRIPTION

    The goal of this library is to offer a "simple" queue system using the
    underlying filesystem for storage, security and to prevent race
    conditions via atomic operations. It focuses on simplicity, robustness
    and scalability.

    Multiple concurrent readers and writers can interact with the same
    queue.

    Other implementations of the same algorithm exist so readers and writers
    can be written in different programming languages:

    Java: <https://github.com/cern-mig/java-dirq>
    Perl: <http://search.cpan.org/dist/Directory-Queue/>
    Python: <https://github.com/cern-mig/python-dirq>

    The Perl implementation is the reference one and contains extensive
    documentation.
